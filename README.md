Data, Orange software (*.ows) and ipynb notebooks used for the research article entitled "Application of machine-learning algorithms for better understanding the properties of liquisolid systems prepared with three mesoporous silica based carriers".
Folder "Orange files" contains the data and software specific files that contain the layout of the modeling (machine learning, ML) procedures. Orange is a visual programming software that has built-in widgets. Some of the additional functionalites were explored through writing Python scripts and connecting them within the layout. These scripts were used to evaluate the training and testing error for the leave-one-out cross-validation approach. Scripts are uploaded in the "Orange scripts" folder.
Developed models were also saved by the pickle method in "Pickled models folder" and can be utilized for further exploration.
In order to test the robustness of developed ML models jitter analysis was performed and the code is uploaded to "Jitter analysis" folder.
